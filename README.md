#kh-converter

This project was made to save time having to manually convert docx to pdf files for personal writeups. It is a simple python script that uses the `docx2pdf` library to convert all docx files in a directory to pdf files.

Currently the release of this program will only work on macOS, however there is nothing stopping you from closing the repo and running the python script on your own machine.
